Get HTTP and SQL SPNs from Active Directory and export the results to HTML.
I use this to check for duplicate SPNs in Active Directory.
This will generate a nice HTML report that shows all SPNs and the related databases.
This is very useful when trying resolve duplicate spns in AD.
Windows 2012 R2 Forest/Domain functional level does not have duplicate SPNs but this would still be good to view SPNs associated to accounts in AD.
